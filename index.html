        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychologist</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Alice Orme<br>I am currently a second year  student at the University of California - Riverside. I am majoring in Psychology with a minor in business, my goals are to become either a therapist or a psychiatrist. After a couple of years, I plan on opening my own business, but of course after I have gained enough experience for that to be accomplished. I am a hard working student who once has set her mind to something, will do her best to accomplish it. I hope to help those in the future. I want to proudly call myself a doctor who can either prescribe medication to help those in need of it, or offer consultation therapy to those who need professional help. I am studying with hopes that it will be smooth sailing, however, I know that the journey of becoming a doctor is not an easy one. With hard work and determination, I plan on achieving this goal. I am a team player, I enjoy working with others while we create or solve new problems, but I also want to be a leader. I want to guide people, I believe that since I was a young child that I have had a strong mindset. I understand that being a leader comes with many responsibilities, such as communication, taking charge, or managing a group. As a leader, I understand that you are to not work against your co-workers but with them, and in hopes of my future business I hope that this is so. I haven’t had any chances to become a leader, but I have acted as a leader in my own way. When I or another co-worker are confused or have something on our minds that we would like to discuss, I make sure I am communicative on any issue. I also make sure that every task I am assigned is complete, or make sure that once I finish my tasks, that I see if any of my co-workers need any help. Even outside the workforce I do my best to take on the role of “leadership”. I try to make sure that anyone who seems to need help is helped with, or if there is something such as “bad tension” happening in my friend group (if given the opportunity) that I bring up the topic to see if it can be resolved. I’m not a perfect human being who is 24/7 a “leader”. I try my best to be and I believe that is what matters. I work hard. I make sure that the time is put in and that I explore every option. I want to be a leader in the future, but I know that it takes time which means that I need to learn how to be patient. I luckily also have that quality. I am a very patient and understanding person, which I believe adds to the quality of being a “leader”. I try not to look only in the eyes of myself but everyone else as well because to others there may be a side that no one else sees.  
<br>

        When I think to myself, who I should thank as my “inspiration” to my goals, it leaves me with a blank slate unfortunately. To be more realistic, I don’t believe I would only have one person to thank but many. I have to thank specifically my parents, for investing into my future and for being the basis of my goals. My father is a family doctor and with my mothers help of managing the clinic, they run a successful clinic. My becoming a doctor wasn’t influenced by my father but I was more influenced and became interested in running a business because of them. I hope that one day if I am lucky enough, to run my own business like my parents. I enjoy the idea that everything would be mainly under my supervision and that I would be controlling the time schedule of the clinic as well as the pay. However, my influence in becoming a therapist is thanks to all my friends and acquaintances. I slowly came to realize over the years that I quite enjoy listening to others' problems and working with them to come up with solutions to those problems. I have also been told that I am quite a good listener and would fit the role of becoming a therapist. I also happen to find the human brain a fascinating subject. It intrigues me to see how our minds work in many different ways compared to others. I am not sure what kind of therapy I would specialize in, but I would hope to specialize counseling from ages anywhere from a child to a senior. I understand that to become one takes long work, especially with having to pass the MCAT, but hoping I pass, and entering into med school that I become a doctor to those who trust. I believe that becoming not only a therapist but a doctor is some of the hardest positions. You want your client to trust you and rely on you so they come back whenever they are experiencing any difficulties. I would like to be recognized as someone who is confident in their word, and that someone should be able to trust my word to hopefully lead them to a better and healthier lifestyle. I look up to doctors. They have a lot of courage, they grind themselves to be someone who helps others, who in a way puts others health before their own sometimes. Doctors are one of the many people in life, who I believe are undermined. They deserve more appreciation for slaving away their time and life, just so they can make the lives of others a better one. I hope to be someone who can influence a child or be looked highly upon just like how I do with doctors. I believe it takes a special kind of person to acquire these jobs and for a reason, and I believe that I can be considered as one of those kinds of people, and be able to show everyone who’s inspired me to become a doctor the impact they made on me.<br><br>

        My plans for the future are only hopeful and achievable if I put the work and effort into them. I believe that for someone to achieve what they want, they must work hard. Time and dedication. No matter where you start from, there will always be some sort of time and dedication a person must put in to achieve their goals. I have worked as a customer service employee for Taco Bell, Sales Associate for Michaels, and as a babysitter for a family. I understand that in order to meet any kind of goal you must make it clear and work towards it however you can. Becoming a therapist, that's the big goal, but there are small tiny goals that should also be focused on I believe. Such as, graduating with a bachelor's degree, finding a job to start you on the right path, becoming stable and saving enough money to afford medical school, and graduating from medical school. There are so many little goals to focus on that need to be achieved first in order to achieve the big and final goal. Right now, I am currently trying to work towards graduating and finding a job afterwards that will help into the future and other current life activities, for example groceries, gas, and bills. If I am being completely honest, I also do hope to become financially stable with this hopefully occupation that I am pursuing. I hope that it will become an occupation that not only I will enjoy because of helping others but because of the income it will bring in for me. Which is another reason why I believe that hard work and determination are what matter. The amount of money equates to the value of what kind of doctor you are. No one wants to fund a badly functioning doctor who doesnt know what they're doing, so that is why you should make sure to put in the time and effort that way you know what you’re doing, creating a clientele base who trust you enough to continue paying for your services. No job is easy, every job requires some sort of hard work and I believe that strongly. I believe that not only do doctors have to work hard to earn their place and money but as well as other occupations such as lawyers or construction workers. Lawyers are responsible for proving someone to be guilty or innocent, whether the person they are representing will have to spend their life in jail and construction workers are relied on to make a stable and functioning building that hundreds or thousands of people will use. Every job has some sort of responsibility and no matter what needs time and dedication to be put in. I have respect for every job, no matter how big or small it may be, just like how I would expect someone to have respect for the time and work I put in to acquire my occupation. I believe this is also another key point to have when wanting to become a potential leader.
